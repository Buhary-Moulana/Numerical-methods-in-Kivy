This Kivy code demonstrates the implementation of four widely used numerical methods in mathematics:

1. Newton-Raphson Method:
The Newton-Raphson method is employed to find at least one root of a given equation. It is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess and refines the approximation with each iteration until it converges to a root. The method is based on calculating the tangent line to the curve at a specific point and finding its intersection with the x-axis, which serves as a better approximation to the root.

2. Gauss-Jacobi Method:
The Gauss-Jacobi method is utilized to solve a system of three equations. It is an iterative approach that iteratively improves the estimates of the variables in the system until they converge to the correct solution. The method is based on decomposing the system of equations into a set of linear equations and updating the values of the variables simultaneously.

3. Simpson's 1/3 Rule:
Simpson's 1/3 Rule is used to approximate the integral of a given function. It employs equally spaced data points to approximate the area under the curve of the function. The rule divides the data points into groups of three and applies a weighted sum formula to obtain an accurate approximation of the integral.

4. Runge-Kutta's 4th Order Method:
Runge-Kutta's 4th Order Method is applied to find the value of the dependent variable in a differential equation, given initial conditions. It is a higher-order numerical method that provides more accurate solutions compared to simpler methods like Euler's method. The method calculates the slope at various points within a small time interval and uses these slopes to update the value of the dependent variable.
